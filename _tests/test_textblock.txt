There are several different docstring formats which one
can use in order to enable Sphinx’s autodoc extension
to automatically generate documentation.

For this tutorial we will use the Sphinx format, since,
as the name suggests, it is the standard format used with Sphinx.
Other formats include Google (see here) and NumPy (see here),
but they require the use of Sphinx’s napoleon extension,
which is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
